# PHP-Projects
A combination of mini projects and exercises I've worked on during my PHP learning phase. There are some PHP concepts, e.g. cookies and others, that i focus on and try to understand them better by building these mini projects. These projects don't just contain pure php code, but also HTML, CSS, and most likely other languages.
